## Testing frameworks

We use {{UNITTEST FRAMEWORK (e.g., jest)}} for unit tests, and {{E2E FRAMEWORK (e.g., cypress)}} for our end-to-end tests.

## Running tests locally

### Configure automation user and password

To run the tests, you first need to configure the user and password.

### Run the tests

You can then use the following commands to run tests:

`yarn test`

## Writing tests

### Assertions

{{Add examples of common assertions used by tests}}

### Best Practices

When writing tests, we follow a few guidelines.

A group of tests is called a "suite". We now have several test suites, each one aims to test a certain set of features in the app. For example, {{path for a test file}} tests the {{feature's name}} feature.

{{Add specific best practices you would like to share}}

### 📄 main.js
```javascript
10           const resp = await handleRequest(request);
11           return resp || new Response('NOTFOUND', {status: 404});
12         } catch (e) {
13           // 如果返回4xx，5xx，Telegram会重试这个消息，后续消息就不会到达，所有webhook的错误都返回200
14           console.error(e);
15           return new Response(errorToString(e), {status: 200});
16         }
